# The waste at the Seashore in Qingdao

I heard that Binhai Park near the sea is so beautiful, it’s so blue and vast.  I’m so happy and I take the bus to here. However, There are many people and waste can be seen along the seashore. I am very disappointed.  [I was shocked to see women throwing waste into the sea.](./sentences/i-saw-some-women-throwing.md)
