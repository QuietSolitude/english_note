# 复合谓语
---
复合谓语（compound predicate）是一个谓语结构，它包含多个动词和动词短语，描述同一个主语的多个动词或状态。复合谓语通常由连词（例如 "and", "or", "but"等）连接两个或多个动词。

连词连接动词：

He went to the store and bought some groceries.

She studied for the exam but didn't pass.

在这些例子中，"went and bought" 和 "studied but didn't pass" 分别是复合谓语，描述了同一个主语的多个动作。

情态动词+主要动词：

She can sing and dance.

They should visit their grandparents and spend time with them.

在这些例子中，"can sing and dance" 和 "should visit and spend" 是复合谓语，包含情态动词和主要动词。

助动词+主要动词：

He is running and eating at the same time.

They have finished their homework and are playing outside.

在这些例子中，"is running and eating" 和 "have finished and are playing" 是复合谓语，包含助动词和主要动词。

通过使用复合谓语，可以更加详细和全面地描述主语的动作或状态。这有助于使句子更加丰富和有趣
