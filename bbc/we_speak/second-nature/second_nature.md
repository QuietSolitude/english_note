**Feifei:**   
I'm very well, thank you. The phrase we're looking at in this programme is 'second nature'. I heard someone use it at work recently talking with a new colleague. He said although recording programmes like this looks complicated, it quickly becomes second nature.

**Beth:**    
Yes. 'Second nature'. That is a great expression. So, when something is second nature, it is so familiar to you that you can do it really easily without having to think about it.
